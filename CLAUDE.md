# Guidelines

- this is a wordpress gutenberg blocks plugin
- you can check the final build of the vh-category-section in http://localhost:8888/?page_id=9
- when naming css classes, follow the BEM pattern
- source files use tabs for indentation; when the Edit tool fails to match due to tab/space mismatch in multi-line strings, use a Python script as fallback
